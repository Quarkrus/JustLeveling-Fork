# JustLeveling Fork
This repo is a fork of the [JustLeveling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-leveling) mod for minecraft forge 1.20.1

The idea behind this fork is fix some bugs, performance issues and allow other persons to contribute to it, so we can get a good mod (:

## Why the fork?
The original mod does have a lot of great features, but sadly it have a lot of performance issues and bugs too, when searching for new versions or news about a future update I find out that it wasn't happening due the original creator `Dplayend` lost the source code, that's why I did take the task on decompiling the code shipped on the .dll, fixed performance issues along with some bugs and released it to the public so anyone searching for a new version of this mod can use this.
Feel free to contribute to it, so we can make this fork a better version of what originally was ^^
